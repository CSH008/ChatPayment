1) User and server messages must exchange position and styles in the App. 
- User: text on the right and no image.
- Server: text on the left and with image.
In addition, the image chosen in the Backend must match that shown in the App for the server.

2) App side chat is NOT refreshing server messages. To see them, you must exit the App and re-enter. That way it loads correctly. This must be corrected and the refreshment must be automatic, just like in whatsapp.

3) A basic push notification is required to notify the user that there are new messages when they are out of the App. This function is basic in any type of chat.

4) Sending files seems to work but has some details that need to be improved:
- The delivery takes a long time and desynchronizes the conversation.
- Receiving the files in the App must have an image that guides the user. Ex: if a pdf is received, the preview of the file and, in case this is very complex, a photo of a typical icon of a pdf file: https://smartcoversystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/ 03 / PDF-download-icon-47146508-updated.jpg
The image, on the other hand, if sent in jpg, png, bmp, etc. format, should show the preview of it.
- Files must be sent to the user's device, not be a link to the server. Because that would give the user URL information, a URL that you should not know.

5) Backbutton behavior in the App.
- being in the Chat tab the backbutton should lead to the information tab. And being in the information tab, the backbutton must have to be pressed 2 times in a row to exit the App, otherwise, it does not close the App and stays in the information menu. Then: tap once and toast a message: "Tap twice to quit". If the user clicks again, in less than 3 seconds, he leaves the app. If you don't do anything and the next time you touch the backbutton repeat step 1.

6) you would have to configure the Paypal sandbox to be able to perform payment simulations and test this function, which is important.

7) the process of validation / verification of user still does not work as such. Anyone can register with any number.

8) why are you asking for privileges of:
- Camera
- Get Accounts
- Read Phone State ??
I want to avoid asking for unnecessary privileges because it discourages the user and scares him. That's why I consult what they are used for.

9) In the backend, when entering a new message, the chat that corresponds to that message does not rise to the top. In turn, when sending a new message from the Backend the screen is not scrolling in the background.
